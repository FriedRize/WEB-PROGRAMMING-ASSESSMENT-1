<h2>WHAT IS SISIG?</h2>
<div class="pragraphSection">
<p>
Sisig is a Filipino dish that originated in Pampanga, a province known for its rich culinary heritage. The term "sisig" comes from an old Kapampangan word meaning "to snack on something sour," originally referring to a salad made with green papaya or guava, dressed with vinegar.<br>
The modern version of sisig, made from chopped pig’s face (maskara) and ears, started in the mid-20th century when locals repurposed discarded pig parts from Clark Air Base. Lucia Cunanan, also known as "Aling Lucing," is credited with popularizing the sizzling version in the 1970s by grilling and seasoning the meat, then serving it on a hot plate with calamansi and chili.<br>
Today, sisig has evolved into various versions, including chicken, seafood, and even vegetarian options, and it remains a beloved Filipino comfort food worldwide.<br>
